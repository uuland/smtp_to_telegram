# Contributing to smtp_to_telegram

I created this program to address a specific need I had: receiving important
alerts on my phone quickly through a convenient application.

Currently, I consider this program to be feature-complete for my requirements,
so I don't require any assistance or additional features at the moment.

I kindly request that you respect my decision to decline any suggestions or
patches for new features that I may not wish to maintain.

That said, I must be upfront that the chances of me accepting any patch are very
low. I apologize if this comes across as arrogant, but I simply cannot invest
additional time in this project.

Feel free to fork this project and customize it to suit your own needs. The
program is designed to be straightforward, so I believe it should be easy for
you. Just remember to comply with the MIT License.
